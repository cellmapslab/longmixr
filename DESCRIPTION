Description: An adaption of the consensus clustering approach from
    'ConsensusClusteringPlus' for longitudinal data. The longitudinal data is
    clustered with flexible mixture models from 'flexmix', while the consensus
    matrices are hierarchically clustered as in 'ConsensusClusterPlus'. By using
    the flexibility from 'flexmix' and 'FactoMineR', one can use mixed data
    types for the clustering.
